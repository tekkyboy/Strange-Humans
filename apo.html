    <h1>All the Strange, Strange Humans - 2022 Edition</h1>
    <p>This website is dedicated to all of the people that I've met over the past 10 years of my life. Forever grateful
        for the opportunity to have met them all.</p>

    <h2>The Alpha Phi Omega era (Fall 2018 - Fall 2021)</h2>
    <div>The Alpha Phi Omega era of my life lasted for a good three years of my life. Personally
        speaking, I'm surprised that Alpha Phi Omega impacted my life for as long as it did given the following: </div>
    <ul>
        <li>I pledged for the fraternity during Fall 2018.</li>
        <li>I stayed active with the fraternity for Spring 2019 until external circumstances caused me to retire early.
        </li>
        <li>I stayed around the fraternity for Fall 2019 as an inactive member.</li>
        <li>In Spring 2020, the fraternity was closed due to COVID-19.</li>
    </ul>
    <div>Nonetheless, I would say that being in Alpha Phi Omega influenced me as an individual for the better I should
        say. It certainly impacted my college life the most as everyone helped me to be more open minded about the life
        styles and situations of other people beyond my own life and the people I grew up with from the high school era.

    <p>"Ah well... I was just coming and going as usual, tuning in and out however I feel like. But it's my duty to help
        out wherever I can."</p>
    <div>
        When I first started college, I was someone who was rather social yet socially awkward at the same time.
        Eventually, I grew out of my socially awkward phase and became more comfortable talking to other people
        with ease. Yet I was far more authoritative and brutally honest in nature, than I was in high school, with a
        preference for letting everyone else know what I thought of any topic during any given time. Eventually that
        phase mellowed out over the pandemic, learning to talk less and started listening more to others.
        Becoming more caring by learning to respect the decisions and lifestyles of people living different lives
        compared to the life that I lived.

    <h2>About Alpha Phi Omega: </h2>
    <div>Alpha Phi Omega is a national co-ed community service fraternity, found in 350 college campuses across the
        United States. The national organization was started in 1925. My college's chapter was started in 1969 and was
        active until 1997. About 15 years later, the chapter was restarted in 2012 and continued to run for a good 8
        years until the COVID-19 pandemic where the entire chapter was placed under hiatus.</div>
    <br>
    <div>As a community service fraternity, the fraternity was mostly centered on performing community service events
        for our college and our communities. Obviously. We would participate in community service events year round,
        ranging from campus clean-up events to planting trees to serving in homeless shelters. Apart from that, we would
        also spend agood amount of time getting dinner and/or boba, visiting major sites like Downtown Disney
        or a random mall, or attending other Alpha Phi Omega chapters within the SoCal region.</div>
    <br>
    <div>The majority of Alpha Phi Omega's membership was composed of mostly Asian Americans with several Hisapnic
        Americans. A bulk of the membership consisted of individuals from the San Gabriel Valley, but there were others
        from cities such San Bernardino, Long Beach, and Anaheim and their neighboring cities.</div>
    <br>
    <div>I would say that almost everyone was loyal towards each other at one point or another. Before the chapter was
        placed on hiatus, our entire chapter operated on the mentality of 'Nobody Left Behind'. And since our chapter
        was smaller than most chapters, about 60 active members in total when I pledged, everyone cared about each other
        to one extent or another.</div>
    <hr>
    <h2>About my Alpha Phi Omega era friendships: </h2>
    <div>Not all of my friends during this time were from Alpha Phi Omega. A majority of them were though. And those who
        weren't in Alpha Phi Omega did hear me talk about the fraternity a lot during the pre-pandemic years.
        But that said though, all of the friends that I made during this era of my life were far more exploratory in
        nature. They were always pushing themselves to explore different lifestyles and to enjoy life as much as
        possible, often to the point of great and extreme personal risk.</div>
    <br>
    <div>Due to the complex nature of the college life, I will be dividing my friends based on when I met them first in
        regards to my career with Alpha Phi Omega. </div>
