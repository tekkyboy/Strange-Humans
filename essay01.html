    <h2>
        Essay 01 - Changing Relationships: Friends, Enemies, Allies, Love Interests
    </h2>
    <h4>An Introduction</h4>
    <div>I would like to begin this by saying that my defintion of relationships has changed over time. I think everyone
        can agree that their definition of relationships have changed over time as well.
        In elementary school, we say that the people that we talk to the most are our friends and the ones that are mean
        to us are our enemies. We don't ever think about making allies as we lived with a black and white mentality of
        what's right and wrong. And as far we're concerned, our love interests tend to be shallow. We fall for those who
        appear to be the most physically attractive.</div>

    <div>Beyond elementary school, say our teenage years (average ages of 13
        - 17), these definitions change. We consider making allies for temporary situations - perhaps for group projects
        and that's it. Our love interests are a bit more complex, say that they're the only person that can make us
        laugh or smile or whatnot. But love is certainly not that deep. However, the definition of friendship becomes
        more complex. As we get older, we tend to hold our friends to certain ideals and certain expectations. If you're
        social, you expect your friends to be more social. If you're more introverted, you expect your friends to
        respect your space. In this environment, it's no longer about the people you like talking the most, it's about
        who can help you be your best self. Your enemies on the other hand, tend to be more complicated. Sometimes they
        tend to be opposing the values that you hold to be important, rather than just badmouthing your presence. Or
        maybe your enemies still tend to hate you, but far more worse and for far more superficial reasons like your
        race or religion or sexual orientation or economic status or whatever core identity that makes you, you.</div>

    <div>In college, these dynamics are more or less the same. But as one gets older, one tends to have more allies than
        friends. It's not clear when that distinction is made but it becomes more noticable over time. What does remain
        a constant though is how our perception of love becomes more complex. When we mature as young adults, we begin
        to fall in love for more genuine reasons than similarities of personal interest.</div>

    <h4>Status of my personal relationships:</h4>

    <div>I would like to say that I have more allies than friends. For a long time, I thought I had more friends than
        allies. But as I get older, I realize that I'm just very good at talking to people. I'm very good at
        understanding most people and what makes them work. But I've also haven't had the luxury of community. I've
        always been someone who drifts about from place to place, someone whose constantly learning and growing from the
        people around him.</div>

    <div>I will say that most of my allies do come from places where I met my friends. I do have a good amount of allies
        from El Modena High School, Alpha Phi Omega, and Epic Movement. They are allies usually because we have an issue
        that units us together. When the issue is resolved, we don't have that reason to communicate with each other.
    </div>

    <div>But I call a good amount of them allies because I know that on any given day that we will no longer be in touch
        with each other. Either due to the passing of time, a change of interests, or due to me cocking something up,
        people tend to leave my life. </div>

    <h4>What makes a close friend?</h4>

    <div>For me, close friends are those who I hold an invested interest in them because they tend to surprise me in one
        way or another. And this element of surprise is what keeps me grounded
        in reality. Because I due tend to think that I'm better than mainstream society. But I do need people who are
        better than me in certain aspects to keep me grounded just enough to remind me that I'm still human at the end
        of the day.</div>

    <h4>Who are my close friends and why am I close friends with them?</h4>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Caroline</b></li>
        <div>It's due to the sheer legacy of having Caroline as my friend since Kindergarten is one of the reasons why
            I'm still friends
            with
            her. But even if it wasn't due to that chronological fact, I am close friends with her because we are
            both very cold and analytical people. She edges me out more, more times than not on being overtly
            rational. I think our friendship lasts because we both help each other remind each other that we're still
            human.
        </div>
        <li><b>Abigayle</b></li>
        <div>
            Abigayle was my first friend in high school, possibly. It's very hard to tell during that time. Again,
            another chronological legacy example. But even if it wasn't due to this chronological legacy, I consider
            Abigayle to be a close friend because we are both culturally rebels. We rebel from the status quo in our
            ways as a reaction to our negative experience with the status quo.
            But while she finds contentment in living a
            life for herself in spite of the status quo, I do my best to help other people out in spite of past hurt. We
            choose to be friends with each other, I think, due to a mutual hope and investment that the other person
            will live a better future.
        </div>
        <li><b>Darren</b></li>
        <div>
            Darren and I are close friends as we are sacrificial individuals. Darren works hard, if not
            harder than anyone else on this list. Darren knows what he wants and values out of life. Darren and I are,
            ironically enough, social people. But where Darren's brain is more adled towards medical solutions and
            ethics, my brain is more adled towards engineering. Darren, despite his preference for the eccentric and
            non-regulatory mask,
            is a rather practical person who follows the rules. Contrast, to me with my preference to act as the
            law-abiding citizen, encourages this sense of individuality and breaking of the status quo. It is this
            juxtaposition of our natures which gravitate us together.
        </div>
        <li><b>Eric</b></li>
        <div>Eric and I are close friends due to the fact that we are moralistic individuals. We both see society's
            juxtapositions and tend to exploit it to our advantages. Eric is someone who poses as an idealist but is
            hiding a cynic inside the idealism. On the otherhand, I am someone who is publicly cynical but inwardly
            optimistic for the future. It is due to this contrasting morality that we hold each other in tight regard
            for each other. Additionally, Eric is someone who is far more in touch with his cultural origins. Myself on
            the otherhand tend to not define myself by my ethnicity. </div>
        <li><b>Andre</b></li>
        <div>
            Andre and I are close friends as we are both scientific individuals. Andre pursues science for the
            academic merit, while I pursue science for the practical applications. Yet our scientific endevarous focus
            around human beings. Whereas Andre is more concerned about medical science, I'm more concerned about social
            science. It is quite ironic, or fitting, that Andre has investment in the social world than me yet I'm the
            more
            outgoing between the two of us.
        </div>
        <li><b>Kaitlynn</b></li>
        <div>
            Kaitlynn and I are close friends as we are both social individuals.
            Kaitlynn lives for the social moment with the people she talks to and I tend to treat each social event
            like a scientific experiment. While we are both really good at understanding and analyzing human
            relationships, I tend to take these findings rather seriously while she accepts these findings rather
            easily. Again, it is this comparable yet contrasting relationship which makes us close friends.
        </div>
        <li><b>Vanessa</b></li>
        <div>
            Vanessa and I are close friends as we are both investigative individuals. We both like understanding that
            which we don't understand. And we accumulate a lot of knowledge, reflected in the lives we live - primarily
            that we choose to seek out eccentric individuals.
            What makes us different though is that I'm far more reliant on my friends, while Vanessa prefers to not have
            as many friends compared to me.
            Additionally, where I seek out eccentric individuals to understand and possibly help them, Vanessa likes
            knowing eccentric individuals for the novelty of knowing really interesting people.
        </div>
        <li><b>Sara</b></li>
        <div>
            Sara and I are close friends because we are adventerous individuals. It doesn't exactly seem to make sense,
            but I have traveled to more places with Sara than anyone else on this list. Sara and I have this
            relationship where she would often ask me to hangout with her, usually out of her own personal boredom, and
            then we end up driving to places about SoCal. Due to the scope and range of our trips, they tend to be
            around northern OC. But it needs to be said though that Sara and I both constantly crave adventures to
            combat a sense of chronic boredom.
        </div>
        <li><b>Chauniel</b></li>
        <div>
            Out of everyone on this list, I do have the weakest friendship with Chauniel. Chauniel is more of a friend
            of a friend type of situation here. But I do so potential for him to be a close friend to me overtime.
            I'm not sure what is the one thing that we have in common, yet. But one of the few things it's looking like
            is the fact that we're both pretty loyal to those who treat us well.
        </div>
        <li><b>Samuel</b></li>
        <div>
            I've met Samuel recently, but I can call Samuel a close friend already. The one thing that we have
            in common is history. Samuel is a history major, I'm just generally well versed in major points in history
            because it fascinated me. I think the fact that Sam and I appreciate human society, it's history, and the
            way we can prevent mistakes by learning from history are the solid foundations of close friendships.
            I think the one thing that makes me different from Samuel though is that Samuel is far more connected to God
            than I am, while I still have my roots grounded on the materialstic world.
        </div>
        <li><b>Taniel</b></li>
        <div>
            I've met Taniel recently as well, but I can also call Taniel a close friend because we're both
            open-minded individuals with an interest in Doctor Who, Star Wars, and Star Trek. Both Taniel and I walk
            about with a large an open heart, doing our best to make everyone we meet feel welcomed. What makes us
            different is that Taniel has stayed loyal to his group for all four years of college, while I've been
            bouncing from group to group as I've never really belonged to just one group.
        </div>
        <li><b>Yannah</b></li>
        <div>
            Yannah is interesting in that she is perhaps the first friend I made in college and perhaps also the latest
            friend I made in college. I consider Yannah to be a close friend to me because we're both struggling
            Christians.
            She struggles in her faith in the Lord, and at times so do I. To be fair, all Christians struggle to
            maintain faith in God especially when bad events and negative tragedies occur. But Yannah and I share the
            same type of struggle. And it's this mutual struggling that helps us
            be closer to each other. So I consider Yannah to be a close friend because I would like to struggle with
            her.
        </div>
