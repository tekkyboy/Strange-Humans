    <h1>All the Strange, Strange Humans - 2022 Edition</h1>
    <p>This website is dedicated to all of the people that I've met over the past several years of my life. Forever
        grateful
        for the opportunity to have met them all.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Disclaimer: The following humans are indeed real life human beings. However due to general privacy concerns
        regarding the nature of the internet, many personal details have been altered for the safety of the real life
        individuals that are my friends. Namely, each and everyone of you. So, in fairness, every person represented
        will have a lot of details altered but still generally accurate so that those who know who each individually
        really is will know and appreciate the references. And so that those who don't know, won't know if the person is
        in fact real. </p>
